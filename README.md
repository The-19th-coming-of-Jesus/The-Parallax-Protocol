### Whats my current vision for the game is 
*The Parallax Protocal*, or *TPP*, is a co-op Get-in Get-out style game, not too dissimilar to GTFO.
Set in space, in the future or an alternative timeline or whatever, players form a group of "Agents", effectively scavengers, up to 4 (tbc) are sent aboard abandoned and partially destroyed space stations / ships. 

Big ones.

Missions have various goals, and the general setting for each mission will remain the same but the internal layout should have randomised elements. Objectives will range from things such as retrieval, survival, repair, destory and other general missions, potentially getting more and more non-sensical as the game progresses? (See [Mission Types](#mission-types))

The "Antagonists" of the game are "Echoes", or scientifically "Tenebridae" being the Genus name, with subnames for individual names. They are otherwordly creatures of varying types, having multiple different species. These species all have specialised adaptations -- stalking, mimicry, vibrational detection, alertion, etc -- and players must learn to identify these creatures and deal with them accordingly. (See [Echoes](#echoes)).

This game is designed to be difficult, to take a while to complete, to have extreme teamwork and skill, and even a little bit of luck and patience to pull these things off. It should be designed not to give a "youre the main character" vibe, but one more of a "this is how small you are in the face of the unknown" (that could be turned into a banger teaser line ngl). [Supplies](#supplies) will have to be managed carefully, at the beginning of each run one may choose to swap around supplies, even weapons for more supplies, and some may be found in the map, but could take you off course of your end objective in order to collect them. All runs will be timed, with an automatic failure upon timer end, timers should get more and more pressing the harder the run, with the easier runs having some margin for error and the later runs requiring some ingenuity to make it.

A run can end in multiple different ways, and locations -- sometimes you'll have to make your way back to the starting point, potentially being swarmed, other times you'll have to find a good pickup place and defend it while your ship comes over, etc. (See [Run Endings](#run-endings))
After ending a run, still living players will be rewarded with... *something* idk, that they can use to invest in small upgrades, supply replenishes, and boosters. These things, when brought into a run, are all lost upon a player being left behind, so even if other players complete the mission, if someone is left behind they will not get any bonuses, and they'll lose the things they brought into the mission. 

And Finally.

The major "draw" for the game, what'll set it apart from other similar ones and what might want to make me end it all trying to implement it, is a "dynamic environment". My vision for this is kinda lengthy and quite complex, so it deserves its own section just below this.

> This is my vision for *The Parallax Protocal*, I hope you're interested enough in helping me turn it from an echo in my head, to a reality worth looting :)

### The Environment
When I said this would be complex, I did indeed mean it would be complex. Im talking [Mirror Realities](#mirror-realities), [Superpositioned States](#superposition), [Emotional Adaptation](#emotional-adaptation), [Destructability & Constructability](#destructability-and-constructability), and [Discrepant Realities](#discrepancies).

I know I know it sounds like alot, and not all of it has to make it into the final game, but these are just preliminary ideas that I thought would be super cool to actually employ. Like I said, it's complex so I've split them all into their own subheadings for better explanation.

#### Mirror Realities
This environment style will see the team split in half, where actions done by one team in one reality has a mirror effect (opposing) effect in the other's. Im unsure if I want dedicated maps to be mirror realities OR if it'd be better employed as a state players can enter and potentially exit using a device?
Maybe we could force its use by having enemies that can jump between the realities and cause havoc if left untreated. 
But, for example, destroying a wall in one reality could block off something in the mirror reality.
Some items might only be found in mirrored realities, etc.

#### Superposition
Superposition is where the players are all deemed as the same "quantum particle", in a sense, and each of their positions is where they all could be or none of them could be, and only until observed do they all "collapse" into the same state. (being teleported to that state). This could encourage / expose huge stealth oppertunities with winding labyrinth like maps requiring huge exploration to find the objective, but not alot of time, So the team could "entangle" themselves and set off in individual directions, to explore individually and then bring the entire team to the correct spot when needed.
How does one get "observed", well thats easy -- do something that would warrent your observation, like getting aggro'd by an enemy. This would mean a huge requirement for stealth, as if one of the players accidentally gets observed in a trap room, they would bring the entire squad into the trap. 

Would also be fun if there were enemies that could be superpositioned too?

#### Emotional Adaptation
This one I'm a little iffy on, it'll be interesting to implement. Based on how the players are playing (cautiously, reacting fast, reacting slow, wasting ammo, perhaps on friendly fire and voice tone??) the environment could react to it and how small changes based on it, having more fires if they're aggressively playing, or more general hazards if theyre playing stealthily, etc. This one I'm on the shelf about, could go well or could be useless.

#### Destructability and Constructability
This one's pretty simple compared to the rest, but could also be the most versitile. Im talking about repairing walls, blowing holes in walls, that sort of stuff. This'll have to be CAREFULLY balanced since we dont want them just blasting their way to the end goal, but we also want it to be fun. Consequences of stuff could be stuff like:
- Blowing a hole in a wall could open up to a room FULL of enemies that are now aggro'd on you
- Repairing a hole in a wall restoring integrity to the room that will reactivate gravity and air slamming you to the floor
- Opening a hole in the wall in a previously sealed room having everything suddenly pulled out of that hole into space
- Opening too many holes could have the map disassemble due to lack of structural integrity
- Could draw in more enemies from outside the map
- etc

#### Discrepancies
Now this one is ALSO gonna be complex! And situational!
Simply though? It'll just be things in runs that don't make sense.
Such as:
- Rooms that seem to be built backwards
- Rooms that wrap around to other rooms in a non-sensical way
- Maps that don't make sense
- Voice Chat / audio coming from directions it shouldn't be
- anti-gravity in rooms that had normal gravity before
- Backtracking through rooms has them upside down or reversed
- [Mirror reality](#mirror-realities) might have doors where there's a wall in the original reality
- Destroyed holes could repair themselves
- Etc
