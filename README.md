## Inspiration
Firstly we gotta note down where I'm getting my inspiration from, lets be honest everything is just combining what we feel is the best of other experiences.
I play a bunch of different games, a lot of shooters, so, this being a co-op extraction shooter I'm gonna be taking inspiration from FPS games.
One such game would be GTFO, the primary source of inspiration for this, you can check out a good summary video on GTFO [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-9M5VMeXCY). I do recommend you watch it.
Another would be Rainbow Six Siege, or Valorant (depending on your mental state), taking their tactical aspects and abilities as inspiration for gadgets and gadget gameplay.

## Whats my current vision for the game is 
*The Parallax Protocol*, or *TPP*, is a co-op Get-in Get-out style game, not too dissimilar to GTFO.
Set in space, in the future or an alternative timeline or whatever, players form a group of "Agents", effectively scavengers, up to 4 (tbc) are sent aboard abandoned and partially destroyed space stations / ships. 

Big ones.

Missions have various goals, and the general setting for each mission will remain the same but the internal layout should have randomised elements. Objectives will range from things such as retrieval, survival, repair, destory and other general missions, potentially getting more and more non-sensical as the game progresses? (See [Mission Types](#mission-types))

The "Antagonists" of the game are "Echoes", or scientifically "Tenebridae" being the Genus name, with subnames for individual names. They are otherwordly creatures of varying types, having multiple different species. These species all have specialised adaptations -- stalking, mimicry, vibrational detection, alertion, etc -- and players must learn to identify these creatures and deal with them accordingly. (See [Echoes](#echoes)).

This game is designed to be difficult, to take a while to complete, to have extreme teamwork and skill, and even a little bit of luck and patience to pull these things off. It should be designed not to give a "youre the main character" vibe, but one more of a "this is how small you are in the face of the unknown" (that could be turned into a banger teaser line ngl). [Supplies](#supplies) will have to be managed carefully, at the beginning of each run one may choose to swap around supplies, even weapons for more supplies, and some may be found in the map, but could take you off course of your end objective in order to collect them. All runs will be timed, with an automatic failure upon timer end, timers should get more and more pressing the harder the run, with the easier runs having some margin for error and the later runs requiring some ingenuity to make it.

A run can end in multiple different ways, and locations -- sometimes you'll have to make your way back to the starting point, potentially being swarmed, other times you'll have to find a good pickup place and defend it while your ship comes over, etc. (See [Run Endings](#run-endings))
After ending a run, still living players will be rewarded with... *something* idk, that they can use to invest in small upgrades, supply replenishes, and boosters. These things, when brought into a run, are all lost upon a player being left behind, so even if other players complete the mission, if someone is left behind they will not get any bonuses, and they'll lose the things they brought into the mission. 

And Finally.

The major "draw" for the game, what'll set it apart from other similar ones and what might want to make me end it all trying to implement it, is a "dynamic environment". My vision for this is kinda lengthy and quite complex, so it deserves its own section just below this.

> This is my vision for *The Parallax Protocol*, I hope you're interested enough in helping me turn it from an echo in my head, to a reality worth looting c:

## The Environment
When I said this would be complex, I did indeed mean it would be complex. Im talking [Mirror Realities](#mirror-realities), [Superpositioned States](#superposition), [Emotional Adaptation](#emotional-adaptation), [Destructability & Constructability](#destructability-and-constructability), and [Discrepant Realities](#discrepancies).

I know I know it sounds like alot, and not all of it has to make it into the final game, but these are just preliminary ideas that I thought would be super cool to actually employ. Like I said, it's complex so I've split them all into their own subheadings for better explanation.

### Mirror Realities
This environment style will see the team split in half, where actions done by one team in one reality has a mirror effect (opposing) effect in the other's. Im unsure if I want dedicated maps to be mirror realities OR if it'd be better employed as a state players can enter and potentially exit using a device?
Maybe we could force its use by having enemies that can jump between the realities and cause havoc if left untreated. 
But, for example, destroying a wall in one reality could block off something in the mirror reality.
Some items might only be found in mirrored realities, etc.

### Superposition
Superposition is where the players are all deemed as the same "quantum particle", in a sense, and each of their positions is where they all could be or none of them could be, and only until observed do they all "collapse" into the same state. (being teleported to that state). This could encourage / expose huge stealth oppertunities with winding labyrinth like maps requiring huge exploration to find the objective, but not alot of time, So the team could "entangle" themselves and set off in individual directions, to explore individually and then bring the entire team to the correct spot when needed.
How does one get "observed", well thats easy -- do something that would warrent your observation, like getting aggro'd by an enemy. This would mean a huge requirement for stealth, as if one of the players accidentally gets observed in a trap room, they would bring the entire squad into the trap. 

Would also be fun if there were enemies that could be superpositioned too?

### Emotional Adaptation
This one I'm a little iffy on, it'll be interesting to implement. Based on how the players are playing (cautiously, reacting fast, reacting slow, wasting ammo, perhaps on friendly fire and voice tone??) the environment could react to it and how small changes based on it, having more fires if they're aggressively playing, or more general hazards if theyre playing stealthily, etc. This one I'm on the shelf about, could go well or could be useless.

### Destructability and Constructability
This one's pretty simple compared to the rest, but could also be the most versitile. Im talking about repairing walls, blowing holes in walls, that sort of stuff. This'll have to be CAREFULLY balanced since we dont want them just blasting their way to the end goal, but we also want it to be fun. Consequences of stuff could be stuff like:
- Blowing a hole in a wall could open up to a room FULL of enemies that are now aggro'd on you
- Repairing a hole in a wall restoring integrity to the room that will reactivate gravity and air slamming you to the floor
- Opening a hole in the wall in a previously sealed room having everything suddenly pulled out of that hole into space
- Opening too many holes could have the map disassemble due to lack of structural integrity
- Could draw in more enemies from outside the map
- etc

### Discrepancies
Now this one is ALSO gonna be complex! And situational!
Simply though? It'll just be things in runs that don't make sense.
Such as:
- Rooms that seem to be built backwards
- Rooms that wrap around to other rooms in a non-sensical way
- Maps that don't make sense
- Voice Chat / audio coming from directions it shouldn't be
- anti-gravity in rooms that had normal gravity before
- Backtracking through rooms has them upside down or reversed
- [Mirror reality](#mirror-realities) might have doors where there's a wall in the original reality
- Destroyed holes could repair themselves
- Etc

## Echoes
The enemies of the game, their genus colloquially referred to as "Echoes", or scientifically called "Tenebridae", meaning "Family of Dark Creatures" *(NOT to be confused with [Darkling Beetles](Tenebrionidae))*, are otherwordly creatures of all kinds. There doesn't have to be an exact theme to their style -- some can be nigh-human like and some can be ungodly abominations. Perhaps they're some sort of vestigal hivemind that's just assimilating creatures they come across, a species of Thesis?
Anyway, they're adaptable creatures on a species level, but usually specialised between variants (variants are what I'll be calling "sub species" or different enemies).
All names below are up for debate lol, I just had some fun.

### Tenebridae Resonaphora (Resona, Latin "resonate"; Phora, Latin "carrier"), Drummers
Emits periodic, rhythmic drums using sensory feelers extending from its head down to the floor. Movement by players or objects or just general movement in closeish proximity during clicks creates detectable vibrations. Excessive vibrations will alert the drummer, and it will proceed to attempt to alert nearby enemies while aggressively homing in on the vibrations. The range of the drummer can be determined by the intensity of the clicks and the size / amount of the feelers.
Visually, they look like tall humanoids with an amount of feelers extending down from their head down to the floor, usually slightly curled up and away from the floor when not in its detection phase. They have pale, ghostly skin with legs that suffer from holes and no distinct arms apart from where larger holes seem to seperate from the central mass to other masses that could resemble arm growths. 
They attack at a small range by flinging the feelers at the target.

### Tenebridae Caecophoni (Caeco, Latin "blind"; Phoni, Latin "sound"), Rushers
Blind predator; relies entirely on vibration detection. Moves in extremely fast, linear bursts toward movement sources, attacking in a mad rush. Upon hitting something or rushing further than the hot spot, it will listen for another vibration source and either pursue and repeat towards it, or rush off in another random direction and then lose aggro.
Visually they look like a humanoid figure curled up in a fetal position rotated forward by 90 degrees so the back is facing the floor and the head is at the front of the creature but with the head pulled out of the fetal position and facing forwards, with features resembling arms and legs within the curl, and multiple extra limbs it uses to actually walk and sprint on growing out of the back.

### Tenebridae Ferrivora (Ferri, Latin "iron"; Vora, Latin "devour"), Corroders
Actively seek out metallic or electronic equipment, rapidly damaging player gear upon touch, draining ammo or battery life. Prioritize aggressive action toward the best-equipped player.
Visual: Bulky, quadrupedal, beetle-like armor-plated bodies, emitting rust-colored corrosive fluids; thick appendages lined with acidic secretions.

### Tenebridae Lucernavora (Lucerna, Latin "lamp/light"; Vora, Latin "devour"), Seers
They have exceptional darkvision in their forwards direction but are otherwise senseless. They will aggressively attack sources of light, or general non-enemy movement with a fevour, prioritising sources of light.
Visual: Floating entities resembling floating jellyfish merged with anglerfish, translucent flesh with shifting bioluminescent cores, suspended gently until provoked.

### Tenebridae Umbrapedes (Umbra, Latin "shadow"; Pedes, Latin "feet"), Shades
Stealth units blending into shadows, immobile while unprovoked, lunging rapidly when players draw near. They can only attack from shadowed areas, making bright lighting essential in preventing attacks.
Visual: Flat, dark, arachnid-human silhouettes creeping along surfaces; their limbs stretch grotesquely as they strike from shadow.

### Tenebridae Pravustrahentium (Pravus, Latin "perverse"; trahentium, Latin "trail"), Distorters
Confuse players by leaving false footprints or emitting misleading audio cues. If approached directly, they distort reality temporarily, flipping gravity, rearranging room layouts briefly, or causing disorientation.
Visual: Shifting, shimmering, ethereal humanoid forms partially phased in reality, distorting nearby air like heat haze. Their full body is a colour-changing, large incestoid of a humanoid stature, with segements like a centepede and 6 furred leg/arm like appendages

### Tenebridae Ferrivora (Ferri, Latin "iron"; Vora, Latin "devour"), Corroders
Actively seek out metallic or electronic equipment, rapidly damaging player gear upon touch, draining ammo or battery life. Prioritize aggressive action toward the best-equipped player. Aggro'd towards whatever the largest electric discharge nearby is
Visual: Bulky, quadrupedal, beetle-like armor-plated bodies, emitting rust-colored corrosive fluids; thick appendages lined with acidic secretions.

### Tenebridae Echoformis (Echo, Greek/Latin "echo"; Formis, Latin "shaped"), Whisperers
Repeatedly whisper distorted phrases players have recently spoken in voice chat, confusing communication. Will physically attack only if provoked directly.
Visual: Skeletal, humanoid frames, large gaping mouths, no visible eyes or ears, translucent ghostly skin pulsating as it echoes voices.

### Tenebridae Exoculidae (Ex, Latin "without"; Oculi, Latin "eyes"), Gazers
Stationary sentries with numerous "eye" sockets scanning a wide area. They cause continuous distress (slowed movement and blurred vision) to players within their gaze. Can only be safely bypassed using cover or by destroying their eye clusters.
Visual: Monolithic columns of pale, stone-like flesh, densely packed clusters of empty eye sockets, rotating slowly, twitching constantly.

### Tenebridae Aerivenari (Aeri, Latin "air"; Venari, Latin "hunt"), Floaters
Patrol open, airy spaces by hovering silently above. Attack by dropping onto targets and lifting them briefly to cause injury and separation from teammates. Avoidable by observing shadows or listening for subtle air currents.
Visual: Large, swollen balloon-like bodies with hanging skeletal arms, floating silently; bodies pulsate gently, breathing rhythmically as they glide.

### Tenebridae Spiculomorpha (Spicula, Latin "spike"; Morpha, Latin "shape"), Impailers
Rapidly dash short distances, stabbing players with long protruding spikes, causing significant bleeding damage. Highly agile but fragile.
Visual: Thin, wiry figures covered in bone-white, razor-sharp spikes protruding chaotically in all directions, insect-like movements, twitchy and erratic.

### Tenebridae Carnifex (Carnifex, Latin "executioner"), Reapers
Powerful, tank-like entities with extreme melee damage. Slow until alerted, then charge ferociously toward players, destroying structures and obstacles in pursuit.
Visual: Hulking, humanoid monstrosities with grotesquely enlarged upper bodies, massive arms ending in cleaver-like bone appendages; faces masked with crude bone plates.

### Tenebridae Nebulaphaga (Nebula, Latin "mist"; Phaga, Latin "eater"), Fog Eaters
Only emerge within foggy or misty rooms, invisible except as disturbances within mist. Gradually drain health if a player stays within mist for too long; repelled by heat sources or ventilation.
Visual: Amorphous, cloud-like forms with faint glowing cores visible briefly as shadows passing through mist -- they have coporeal forms that can be killed in mirror dimensions.

### Tenebridae Furivolans (Furor, Latin "rage"; Volans, Latin "flying"), Swarmers
Small, aggressive swarm units attacking in packs, easily dispatched alone but overwhelming in numbers. Attracted by loud noises, bright lights, or prolonged player presence.
Visual: Small, bat-like, pitch-black winged creatures with sharp talons, elongated skulls, emitting high-pitched screeches during swarming attacks.

### Tenebridae Animarepetit (Anima, Latin "soul"; repetit, Latin "taker"), Demons
Silently possesses hosts, making enemies faster and more aggressive. When the host is killed, it moves to a new nearby host. If possessing a player in this way, the player may be prone to various effects, such as seeing enemies in the place of teammates, randomly shooting without control, not being able to speak, or even fully losing control and having the Demon attack teammates. Can only be killed in mirror dimensions, but cannot possess enemies in mirror dimensions. If a demon stays outside of a host for too long, it dies.
Visual: Only visable in mirror dimensions, appears as a glowing worm hovering in the air, or wrapped up in place if currently occupying a host

### Tebridae Lucendifur (Lucendi, Latin "lightning"; Fur, Latin "thief"), Drainers
Occupies areas with high amounts of energy (Such as generator rooms, etc) and drain electricity from nearby devices and sectors of the map. Attacks by getting close and electrocuting players, draining battery charge when nearby (Maybe disabling some HUD elements?). Heals self when draining energy from players or the map, but dies quickly otherwise.
Visual: Thin, gaunt humanoids without heads, and numerous metal conductors stuck through the body.

    Reward: Settlement supplies but also settlement destruction depending on the amount of damage done.

---
## The Ending
The "ending" is an event called Infinite Refraction, and it follows as such:
Players realize the Echo infestation is infinite and unstoppable. The ultimate objective shifts to simply just trying to push back an unending horde. Missions become endless loops, progressively more difficult, tasked with mitigating Echo expansion infinitely.

Rewards would pertain to things such as:
- Progressive cosmetic and gear upgrades showing veteran statuses,
- Increasingly rare prestige rewards,
- Special in-game titles, 
- and dynamic, procedurally evolving challenges maintaining long-term engagement.

Hazards:
- Frequent gravity anomalies causing sudden shifts in orientation, complicating combat and traversal.
- Nebulaphaga thriving in thick nebular mists, draining health gradually unless countered.
- Swarms utilizing low visibility to ambush players unpredictably.

### Perdition Arks
Overview:
Secretive, ancient vessels drifting silently, all presumed lost to the void. Internally, it’s a hostile, living nightmare composed of organic and inorganic materials fused disturbingly together.
Environment:
- Bio-organic corridors pulsating and shifting, responding to players.
- Areas alternate randomly between unsettling organic interiors and sterile metallic chambers.
- Entrances and exits closing and reopening unpredictably.

Hazards:
- Emotional adaptation: environment reacts negatively to aggressive or panicked player behaviors, causing increased hazard occurrence. (If implemented, otherwise have the ship get "mood swings")
- Frequent ambushes by Carnifex and Mimica units using environmental camouflage.
- Bio-hazardous traps that immobilize or temporarily incapacitate players.

### Lucidity Cathedrals
Overview: Towering cathedral-like stations constructed for psychological and physiological research, now drifting abandoned. Players experience environmental hallucinations and emotional distortions.
Environment:
- Grand gothic architecture with stained glass windows distorted by reality anomalies.
- Psychological anomalies triggering powerful hallucinations altering players' perception temporarily.
- Large central chambers offering open combat contrasted by narrow hallways and hidden passages.

Hazards:
- Lucernavora attracting players toward hypnotic visual traps.
- Distortion fields causing brief but intense emotional states (panic, dread), impacting player performance.
- Gazer sentinels causing persistent distress in large open areas.
  *note that all effects like "panic" are GUI effects and even control effects, I cannot program a user to induce fear in them*

### Rift Stations
Overview: Stations orbiting dangerously close to a massive black hole, suffering severe gravitational anomalies and time dilation effects.
Environment:
- Areas experiencing varied gravitational forces, including zero-G, low-G, and crushing high-gravity zones.
- Interiors warped and elongated by gravitational tidal forces, corridors stretching impossibly far or collapsing abruptly.
- Visible through windows: the looming, hypnotic presence of the black hole’s event horizon.

Hazards:
- Time dilation traps creating slow-motion or accelerated player movement, complicating combat and traversal strategies.
- Echo variants uniquely adapted to gravity fluctuations (Aerivenari and Floaters dominate here).
- Hull breaches causing lethal decompression events, requiring rapid sealing and repair to avoid catastrophe.
